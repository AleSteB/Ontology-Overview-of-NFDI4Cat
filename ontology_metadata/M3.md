## Comments
The M3 Ontology can be considered more of a Taxonomy as it lags definitions, sets up several Equivalences which are neither well defined nor well hierarchically structured. Some of the classes such as "Phosphorous" also seem to be out of place in a Internet of things Ontology , espaccially if they are not well defined (limited by a definition)
